Mouse Game
=========
mouse game using JS

Description
------
Move your mouse to avoid the red balls, to survive 
Features
----
* pure JS.  
* the mouse pointer is varied according to the images loaded,  
giving a perception of changing directions.
* The red balls are physically redirected at every bounce  
three balls gets added every 5 sec, each at its own speen  
one of these three alyways follows the mouse pointer
* crappy algorithm used for the next move of "following" balls
